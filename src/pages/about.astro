    <h1>About</h1>

    <section class="intro-section">
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Ratko Simidzija, a JavaScript Developer currently working at ePages in
        Germany. I spend my days building e-commerce platforms with React, Remix, and TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before diving into web development, I worked in Business Management for several years. While
        it was interesting, something was missing. In 2020, I made the switch to coding, and it
        turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made. There's something deeply satisfying
        about solving problems through code and seeing features come to life.

      <h2 id="current-work">What I'm Working On</h2>
      <p>
        At ePages, I work on two main platforms: customer storefronts and the Commerce Cockpit, a
        merchant admin system. The stack is React 19, Remix, Redux, and TypeScript, all within a
        monorepo architecture. I write unit tests with Jest and E2E tests with Cypress and
        Playwright to keep things reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commerce Cockpit is a comprehensive admin platform with over 50 views for managing
        products, orders, customers, and more. Working in a monorepo with multiple interconnected
        packages means paying close attention to how changes ripple through the system.

    <section class="experience">
      <h2 id="experience">Background</h2>
      <p>
        Before ePages, I worked as a Frontend Developer at FxPro, a fintech company, from 2022 to
        2023. The focus there was on trading platforms and financial tools built with Angular and
        Svelte. I created landing pages, marketing microsites, email templates for multi-locale
        campaigns, and interactive calculators integrated with Highcharts.
      </p>
      <p>
        My formal training came from DCI Digital Career Institute in Berlin, where I completed a
        Full Stack Web Developer program in 2021. Before that, I earned a Bachelor of Business
        Administration from MBS Business School, which gave me a foundation in how businesses
        work—helpful context when building software for business users.

    <section class="skills">
      <h2 id="skills">Skills & Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Day-to-day, I work mostly with React, TypeScript, and Remix. I've also spent considerable
        time with Angular, Svelte, Redux, and Node.js. Testing is a big part of what I do—Jest for
        unit tests, Cypress and Playwright for E2E testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Build tools like Webpack and Gulp, version control with Git, and Web Accessibility standards
        are all part of the toolkit. Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with Astro (this site is
        built with it) and diving deeper into accessibility best practices.
