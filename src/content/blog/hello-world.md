After months of thinking "I should really build a portfolio site," I finally sat down and did it. I went with [Astro](https://astro.build) for this project, and honestly, it's been a great choice.

## Why Astro?

I've been hearing about Astro for a while, and I wanted to try it out. A few things that sold me:

- It generates static HTML by default, so the site loads fast without shipping unnecessary JavaScript
- The developer experience is solid - TypeScript support, hot reloading, all the stuff you'd want
- Content Collections make managing blog posts straightforward with type safety
- It just gets out of the way and lets you build

Coming from React at work, it was refreshing to work with something focused on static content. No hydration complexity, no client-side routing overhead - just fast pages.

## What I'm Planning

I'll probably write about things I'm learning and problems I'm solving. Right now I'm exploring React 19 features, getting better at web accessibility, and diving deeper into Astro itself.

Not sure how often I'll post, but that's the plan.

## About This Site

Built it with a dark minimalist theme, added an RSS feed, set up proper SEO metadata. Used TypeScript throughout, ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Pretty standard stuff, but it works well.

The code is straightforward if you want to check it out. Thanks for stopping by.
